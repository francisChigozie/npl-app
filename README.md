## Organization name: CALVAZ PRIME CONCEPTS

Address: 9B Rasheed Alatishe Street, Isheri, Magodo, Lagos
Contact email: emekaezekwem5@gmail.com
Intended client: Access Bank PLC, 14/15 Alaba Oniru Road, Victoria Island, Lagos
Principal: Chukwuemeka Alvan Ezekwem (ex–Union Bank Group Head/DGM)
Supervisor: Mrs. Vivian Echefu‑Louis (Recovery Agent lead)
Domain terminology and strategies to reflect:

Recovery methods: EFCC/police escalation (where lawful), litigation, moral suasion, interest waiver incentives (bank‑approved), security realization, attachable assets, periodic reviews with bank recovery heads, and documented odd‑hour visits.
Artifacts: Legal notices, repayment agreements, perfection of mortgages/debentures, write‑offs/restructuring, concession approvals.
Compliance/logging emphasis: Auditability for regulatory review.



- Requirements and Compliance


Stakeholders and Roles

Recovery Agent: creates and updates cases, logs visits/contacts, uploads documents, proposes concessions.
Bank Officer: reviews cases, approves/denies concessions, coordinates legal actions.
Supervisor: oversees agent performance, reassigns cases, validates logs.
Admin: configures system, manages users/roles, audit exports, system health.



- Compliance requirements

Nigeria NDPR + GDPR principles for personal data handling.
PCI‑DSS only if handling card data (avoid storing PAN; prefer tokenized PSP; most likely out of scope).
Evidence-grade audit trails for all actions (immutability via append-only logs).
Data minimization and retention policies; encryption at rest and in transit.
Lawful escalation notes: where EFCC/police/litigation is referenced, ensure role‑gated workflows and legal approval checkpoints with digital sign‑offs.



System Design
